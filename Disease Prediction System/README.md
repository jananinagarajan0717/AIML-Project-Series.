## Project 3:  Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

## Project Description:
The "Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning" project aims to 
develop an intelligent system that predicts the likelihood of a person having a 
particular disease based on various health-related features. The system will 
utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze historical health data and make 
predictions, contributing to early disease detection and proactive healthcare 
management.
